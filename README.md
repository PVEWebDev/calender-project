# calender-project
A project intended for websites/widgets that requires a calender, which I started as a way to properly calculate my hourly wage from a substitute teaching job.

I began designing the wage calculating project, but realized that I did not have the proper data to parse/wrangle at scale, as calender on Aula (the danish web service for public schools), is not allowed to be crawled.
Hence progress so far is a simply piece of code that designs a blank calender for all dates in 2025.
